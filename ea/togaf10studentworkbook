### 1.1 What is Enterprise Architecture?

**Definition:**
> Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of an organization. It determines how technology, processes, people, and information work together to achieve business goals.

**Simple Analogy:**
Think of EA like the blueprints and city planning for a city:
- **Building Architects** design individual buildings (applications)
- **City Planners (EAs)** design how buildings, roads, utilities work together as a whole city (enterprise)

**Key Components of EA:**

### 3.1 ADM Fundamentals

**What Makes the ADM Unique?**

1. **Iterative, Not Waterfall:**
   - You don't do each phase once and never return
   - You iterate within phases and across phases
   - Architecture evolves continuously

2. **Flexible and Adaptable:**
   - Not one-size-fits-all
   - Tailor to organization size, industry, maturity
   - Can focus on specific architecture domains (business, data, application, technology)

3. **Requirements-Centric:**
   - Requirements Management runs throughout all phases
   - Requirements drive architecture decisions
   - Architecture enables requirements to be met

4. **Stakeholder-Focused:**
   - Each phase explicitly considers stakeholder concerns
   - Architecture artifacts are tailored to different audiences
   - Communication is continuous

---

### 3.2 ADM Iteration Strategies

**Three Types of ADM Iteration:**

**1. Iteration Within a Phase:**
- Example: In Phase D (Technology Architecture), iterate multiple times to refine infrastructure design
- Reason: Complex topics require multiple refinement cycles

**2. Iteration Across Phases:**
- Example: Start Phase B (Business Architecture), realize you need to refine Phase A (Vision), go back
- Reason: Learning from later phases informs earlier decisions

**3. Iteration Across the Entire ADM Cycle:**
- Example: Complete full ADM cycle (Preliminary through H), then start again for next evolution
- Reason: Architecture is never "done"; continuous improvement

**When to Iterate?**

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Stakeholder rejects design** | Iterate within current phase to refine |
| **New requirement discovered** | Update Requirements Management, assess impact, may need to revisit prior phases |
| **Architecture doesn't meet business need** | Iterate back to Architecture Vision (Phase A) |
| **Technology landscape changes** | Iterate Phase D (Technology Architecture) |
| **Implementation reveals issues** | Iterate Phases E/F (planning phases) or even architecture phases if fundamental |

### 3.3 ADM Scope Variations

**You don't have to do all architecture domains every time!**

**Scenario 1: Technology Refresh**
- **Focus:** Phase D (Technology Architecture) only
- **Example:** Migrating from on-premises to cloud
- **Phases Used:** Preliminary (if first time), A (vision for migration), D (cloud architecture), E/F (migration planning), G (governance)
- **Phases Skipped:** B (business architecture unchanged), C (applications/data minimally changed)

**Scenario 2: Business Transformation**
- **Focus:** Phases B, C (Business + Applications)
- **Example:** Redesigning customer experience processes
- **Phases Used:** All phases, but B and C are most detailed
- **Phases Light:** D (technology supports new applications but infrastructure mostly unchanged)

**Scenario 3: New Enterprise (Greenfield)**
- **Focus:** All phases in depth
- **Example:** Startup building EA from scratch
- **Phases Used:** All phases, all architecture domains

**Scenario 4: Continuous Improvement**
- **Focus:** Phase H (Change Management) with selective iteration
- **Example:** Established EA with mature architecture
- **Approach:** Monitor, identify changes, selectively iterate phases as needed

---

### 3.4 ADM Inputs and Outputs (High-Level)

**Each ADM phase has:**
- **Inputs:** What you need to start the phase
- **Steps:** Activities you perform
- **Outputs:** Deliverables you produce

### 3.5 Tailoring the ADM

**TOGAF's Golden Rule:**
> "The ADM is a generic method. It must be tailored to suit your organization."

**Common Tailoring Decisions:**

**1. Terminology:**
- TOGAF calls it "Architecture Vision" - your organization calls it "Strategic Blueprint"
- **Decision:** Use your organization's terms, but map to TOGAF concepts

**2. Phase Detail:**
- Phase B (Business Architecture) is your primary focus
- Phases C, D are less detailed (stable infrastructure)
- **Decision:** Spend 50% time on Phase B, 20% on C, 10% on D, 20% on E/F

**3. Deliverables:**
- TOGAF has 40+ potential deliverables
- Your organization needs 10 key documents
- **Decision:** Select subset of TOGAF deliverables that add value

**4. Integration with Existing Methods:**
- You already use Agile/Scrum for development
- TOGAF ADM for enterprise architecture
- **Decision:** ADM provides architecture, Agile teams implement; align cycles

**5. Governance:**
- TOGAF describes Architecture Review Board (ARB)
- Your organization has Enterprise Architecture Council (EAC)
- **Decision:** Map ARB responsibilities to EAC

**Tailoring Document:**
Create a "TOGAF Tailoring Guide" for your organization that documents all tailoring decisions.

You are leading an EA initiative to consolidate 20 legacy applications into 5 modern applications. You've completed:
- ✅ Preliminary Phase (governance established)
- ✅ Phase A (Vision approved by executives)
- ✅ Phase B (Business processes documented)
- ✅ Phase C (Target application architecture designed)

**You're now in Phase D (Technology Architecture).** During infrastructure design, you discover:
- The planned cloud platform cannot support the data residency requirements for 3 of the 5 new applications
- This affects your target application architecture (Phase C)
- May also impact business capabilities (Phase B)

**Your Task:**
1. Which phase(s) do you need to revisit?
2. In what order should you iterate?
3. What specific artifacts need to be updated?
4. Who should you inform of this change?

**Your Answer:**
Phase(s) to revisit: _________________________________

## Chapter 4: Preliminary Phase - Foundation & Preparation

### Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- ✅ Explain the purpose of the Preliminary Phase
- ✅ Define architecture principles
- ✅ Establish architecture governance
- ✅ Tailor TOGAF to your organization
- ✅ Set up the architecture capability

---

### 4.1 Preliminary Phase Overview

**Purpose:**
Prepare the organization to undertake successful enterprise architecture.

**Key Question:**
*"Are we ready to do enterprise architecture?"*

**Preliminary Phase Scope:**
- Define *where*, *what*, *why*, *who*, and *how* we do architecture
- Establish architecture governance and principles
- Tailor TOGAF to organization
- Define architecture tools and repository
- Select frameworks and methodologies

**When to Do Preliminary Phase:**
- First time implementing EA in organization
- Major change to EA approach (e.g., moving from FEAF to TOGAF)
- Establishing EA for a new division or business unit

**Can You Skip Preliminary Phase?**
- If EA capability already exists and is mature → Light refresh instead of full Preliminary Phase
- If EA governance and principles already established → Jump to Phase A
- If starting from scratch → MUST do Preliminary Phase

---

### 4.2 Preliminary Phase Activities

**Activity 1: Scope the Enterprise**

**Define Organizational Scope:**
- What parts of the organization does EA cover?
  - Option A: Entire enterprise (e.g., all of Contoso Manufacturing global)
  - Option B: Business unit (e.g., Contoso North America only)
  - Option C: Domain (e.g., Manufacturing Operations only, not Corporate functions)

**Define Architecture Scope:**
- Which architecture domains are in scope?
  - Business, Data, Application, Technology (all four)
  - Subset (e.g., Technology Architecture only for infrastructure consolidation)

**Define Time Horizon:**
- How far into future does architecture plan?
  - Short-term: 1-2 years
  - Medium-term: 3-5 years (most common)
  - Long-term: 5-10 years

**Example - Contoso Manufacturing:**
- **Organizational Scope:** Global Contoso (all 15 plants, HQ, all functions)
- **Architecture Domains:** All four (Business, Data, Application, Technology)
- **Time Horizon:** 5 years (with detailed planning for first 18 months)
- **Rationale:** GDM initiative requires enterprise-wide transformation

**Key Governance Decisions:**

| Decision | Options | Contoso Choice |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Who approves architecture?** | CIO only / ARB / Executive Committee | ARB (with escalation to Executive Committee for strategic decisions) |
| **How are exceptions handled?** | No exceptions / Case-by-case / Formal dispensation | Formal dispensation process (documented, time-limited) |
| **Architecture compliance?** | Voluntary / Mandatory for major projects / Mandatory for all | Mandatory for all projects >$500K |
| **Enforcement mechanism?** | Recommendations only / Funding gate / CIO approval required | Funding gate (no architecture compliance = no budget) |

---

**Activity 3: Define and Establish Architecture Principles**

**What are Architecture Principles?**

> Architecture Principles are general rules and guidelines that inform and support the way an organization sets about fulfilling its mission.

**Characteristics of Good Principles:**
- ✅ **Understandable:** Clear, concise, no jargon
- ✅ **Robust:** Applicable across time and technology changes
- ✅ **Complete:** Covers all relevant aspects
- ✅ **Consistent:** Principles don't contradict each other
- ✅ **Stable:** Don't change frequently

**Principle Template:**

```
PRINCIPLE NAME: [Short, memorable name]

STATEMENT: [One sentence describing the principle]

RATIONALE: [Why this principle matters]

IMPLICATIONS: [What this principle means in practice]
```

**Contoso Manufacturing Architecture Principles (Examples):**

---

**PRINCIPLE 1: CLOUD-FIRST**

**Statement:**
Cloud platforms are the default choice for all new applications and infrastructure unless there is a compelling reason to use on-premises.

**Rationale:**
Cloud provides agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. On-premises infrastructure has high capital cost, long deployment times, and limited scalability.

**Implications:**
- New applications must be designed cloud-native or cloud-compatible
- Infrastructure projects must justify any on-premises components
- Preference: Microsoft Azure (enterprise agreement already in place)
- Exception process: If cloud not suitable (e.g., OT control systems with latency requirements), document rationale and get ARB approval

---

**PRINCIPLE 2: API-FIRST INTEGRATION**

**Statement:**
All system integrations use standardized, reusable APIs managed through an enterprise API gateway. Point-to-point integrations are prohibited.

**Rationale:**
Current state has 400+ point-to-point integrations creating a brittle, unmaintainable "spaghetti" architecture. API-first reduces integration complexity, increases reusability, and enables faster change.

**Implications:**
- All applications must expose APIs for integration
- New integrations must go through Azure API Management
- Existing point-to-point integrations will be refactored over 3 years
- API design standards must be followed (RESTful, OpenAPI specification)

---

**PRINCIPLE 3: ZERO-TRUST SECURITY**

**Statement:**
Never trust, always verify. Security is enforced at every layer (identity, device, network, application, data), not just at the perimeter.

**Rationale:**
Perimeter-based security is insufficient for cloud and mobile environments. Zero-trust architecture provides defense-in-depth and better protects against modern threats.

**Implications:**
- All access requires authentication and authorization (no implicit trust)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory
- Network microsegmentation replaces flat networks
- Least-privilege access (users/services get minimum permissions needed)
- Continuous monitoring and threat detection

---

**PRINCIPLE 4: DATA IS AN ASSET**

**Statement:**
Data is treated as a corporate asset with defined ownership, quality standards, and governance. Data is shared across the enterprise to drive decisions.

**Rationale:**
Current state has data silos, poor data quality, and inconsistent definitions. Treating data as an asset ensures data-driven decision-making and compliance.

**Implications:**
- Data owners are assigned and accountable for data quality
- Master data (customers, products, suppliers) is managed centrally
- Data architecture includes data lineage and metadata management
- Data sharing is the default; data hoarding is prohibited
- Personal data is protected per GDPR/CCPA requirements

---

**PRINCIPLE 5: STANDARDIZE BEFORE CUSTOMIZE**

**Statement:**
Use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software with standard configurations. Minimize customization. When custom development is needed, use reusable components.

**Rationale:**
Heavy customization increases cost, complexity, and upgrade difficulty. Standardization enables faster deployment, easier maintenance, and lower TCO.

**Implications:**
- ERP (SAP), MES (Siemens Opcenter), CRM (Salesforce) use standard configurations
- Customization requires business case and ARB approval
- Custom code is limited to differentiating capabilities only
- Reusable components/services are preferred over project-specific code

---

**Your Turn: Create a Principle**

**Exercise 4.1:**

Your organization is adopting Agile development practices. Write an architecture principle for "Agile-Aligned Architecture."

**Your Principle:**

**Name:** _________________________________________

**Statement:** _________________________________________
_________________________________________

**Rationale:** _________________________________________
_________________________________________

**Implications:** _________________________________________
_________________________________________

---

**Activity 4: Tailor TOGAF Framework**

**Tailoring Decisions for Contoso:**

| TOGAF Element | Standard TOGAF | Contoso Tailoring |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Terminology** | "Architecture Vision" | Keep TOGAF term (familiar to certified architects) |
| **Phase Emphasis** | Equal weight all phases | Phase C (Applications) and D (Technology) are most detailed (IT transformation focus) |
| **Deliverables** | 40+ potential artifacts | Core set of 12 key deliverables (avoid documentation overload) |
| **Iteration** | Generic guidance | Iterate Phases B-D together (integrated design), then E-F together (planning) |
| **Integration** | Standalone ADM | Integrate with Agile (ADM provides architecture, Scrum teams implement) |
| **Approval** | Architecture Board | ARB approves Phases A-D; Executive Committee approves Phase E/F (budget decisions) |

**Tailoring Documentation:**
Create "Contoso TOGAF Methodology Guide" (30-page document) describing all tailoring decisions, with examples and templates.

---

**Activity 5: Implement Architecture Tools**

**Architecture Repository:**
Central store for all architecture artifacts.

**Contoso Tool Choices:**

| Need | Tool | Rationale |
|------|------|-----------|
| **EA Modeling** | Sparx Enterprise Architect | Industry-standard; supports TOGAF; team already familiar |
| **Requirements Mgmt** | Azure DevOps | Already used for software development; integration with dev teams |
| **Document Repository** | SharePoint | Already used across enterprise; version control; search |
| **Collaboration** | Microsoft Teams | Real-time collaboration; document co-authoring |
| **Project Portfolio** | ServiceNow PPM | Already used for IT portfolio management |
| **Diagrams** | Visio + Lucidchart | Visio for detailed technical; Lucidchart for stakeholder presentations |

**Repository Structure:**

---

## Chapter 5: Phase A - Architecture Vision

### Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- ✅ Create an Architecture Vision that resonates with executives
- ✅ Identify and engage key stakeholders
- ✅ Develop a compelling business case
- ✅ Define the scope and constraints for the architecture work
- ✅ Obtain formal approval to proceed

---

### 5.1 Phase A Overview

**Purpose:**
Create a high-level aspirational vision of the future state and obtain approval to proceed with architecture development.

**Key Question:**
*"What are we trying to achieve, and why should anyone care?"*

**Phase A is About:**
- **Selling** the architecture initiative (getting buy-in)
- **Aligning** architecture with business strategy
- **Scoping** the architecture work
- **Justifying** the investment (business case)

**Critical Success Factor:**
Phase A must resonate with executives and business stakeholders, not just IT. If Phase A fails to get buy-in, the entire ADM cycle stops here.

**Time Investment:**
Typical: 4-6 weeks
Contoso GDM: 8 weeks (large scope, many stakeholders, board approval required)

---

**Document Stakeholder Concerns:**

Each stakeholder group has specific concerns that the architecture must address.

**Example - VP Manufacturing Concerns:**
1. **Concern:** "Will this cause unplanned downtime?" 
   - **Architecture Response:** Phased rollout, pilot approach, fallback plans, testing protocols
2. **Concern:** "My plant managers are skeptical of IT projects"
   - **Architecture Response:** Involve plant managers in design, Dallas pilot to prove value, change management
3. **Concern:** "We can't afford to miss production targets"
   - **Architecture Response:** Implement during planned maintenance windows, buffer capacity, hot-standby systems

---

**Activity 3: Confirm Business Goals, Drivers, and Constraints**

**Business Goals (from Project Charter):**
1. Reduce delivery time: 24 weeks → 10 weeks
2. Manufacturing uptime: 87% → 99%
3. Enable mass customization (lot size 1)
4. Reduce costs by 15%
5. Reduce carbon footprint by 25%

**Underlying Business Drivers:**

**External Drivers:**
- **Competition:** Competitors (TechFab, InnoManuf) delivering faster
- **Customer Expectations:** B2B customers demanding faster, more customized products
- **Digital Disruption:** Industry 4.0, IoT, AI are transforming manufacturing
- **Sustainability Regulations:** Increasing pressure for carbon reduction

**Internal Drivers:**
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual processes, data silos, legacy systems
- **Revenue at Risk:** $200M annual revenue at risk if market share continues to decline
- **Cost Pressure:** Manufacturing costs 18% higher than industry average
- **Technology Debt:** Aging infrastructure, 38% of applications >10 years old

**Constraints:**

| Constraint Type | Description | Impact on Architecture |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Financial** | $180M budget; stage-gate funding | Phased delivery to unlock funding increments |
| **Time** | 18-month deadline (Q4 2025) | Aggressive schedule; pilot-then-scale approach |
| **Technology** | Azure cloud-first (existing EA) | Prefer Azure services; avoid multi-cloud complexity |
| **Operational** | Zero unplanned downtime | High availability architecture; rigorous testing |
| **Regulatory** | GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California) | Data residency, encryption, consent management |
| **Skills** | Limited IoT, AI/ML, OT security expertise | Partner with external specialists; training program |
| **Organizational** | Plant managers have local autonomy | Involve plants early; balance standardization vs. flexibility |

---

**Activity 4: Assess Capability Readiness**

**Current State Assessment:**

Contoso performed a capability maturity assessment across 8 dimensions:

| Capability | Current Maturity (1-5) | Target Maturity | Gap |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Real-Time Manufacturing Visibility** | 1.5 (Lagging) | 4.0 (Leading) | ⬆️ 2.5 |
| **Predictive Maintenance** | 1.0 (None) | 4.0 (Predictive) | ⬆️ 3.0 |
